## **Introduction**

Welcome! This is my very first project using ASP.NET Core and the first project I commit on Github.
This project is made from scratch using Visual Studio Code using LittleAspNetCoreBook as a guide. Get the print-version book for free from [official website](https://recaffeinate.co/book/) or use online version from [Gitbooks](https://nbarbettini.gitbooks.io/little-asp-net-core-book/)
